## Best Practices

* Keep writeups **clear, reproducible, and evidence-based**.
* Separate **exam-related** material from publicly shareable content to comply with NDAs.

* Store only **authorised and legal** materials — no unauthorised target data.

Do you want me to now **make a consistent README template** so all three of these repos use an identical, professional format and tone? That way they’ll look like a unified toolkit.
