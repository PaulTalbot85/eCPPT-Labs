# Multi-Host Linux Enumeration & Lateral Movement Lab — Full Walkthrough & Analysis

## Overview

This lab involved enumerating multiple Linux hosts on a segmented network, leveraging discovered credentials and artifacts to pivot between machines, and ultimately retrieving a series of flags scattered across user accounts. The exercise reinforced skills in:

* Network enumeration (Nmap)
* SSH authentication and pivoting
* File system and user enumeration
* Extracting secrets from local files and browser artifacts
* Password harvesting and lateral movement

---

## Lab Environment

* Network range: `192.171.239.2/24`
* Target machines: `192.171.239.3`, `.4`, `.5`, `.6`
* Users encountered: `sansa`, `dany`, `kate`, `bronn`, `robert`, `bran`, `john`
* Services: SSH on all target hosts

---

## Step-by-Step Approach

### 1. Network & Service Enumeration

* Ran an initial ping sweep and port scan with Nmap to identify live hosts and open ports.

  ```bash
  nmap -sP 192.171.239.2/24
  nmap -sV 192.171.239.3 192.171.239.4 192.171.239.5 192.171.239.6
  ```

* Found SSH running on all hosts.

---

### 2. Initial Access: SSH to `sansa@192.171.239.3`

* Credentials provided in challenge:
  `sansa / welcome@123`

* Logged in, found `flag.txt` and enumerated users via `/etc/passwd`.

---

### 3. User & File Enumeration on Host 1

* Discovered user `dany` and found their home directory.
* `flag.txt` in `/home/dany` was only readable by `dany`.
* Checked `sansa`'s `.bash_history` and found an SSH private key `id_rsa` belonging to user `kate` on the second machine.

---

### 4. Pivot: Using Private Key to Access Host 2 as `kate`

* Copied `id_rsa` to local machine and set strict permissions (`chmod 400 id_rsa`).
* SSH'd into `kate@192.171.239.4` using the key.
* Retrieved `flag.txt` for `kate`.

---

### 5. Enumerating Users and Files on Host 2

* Found `bronn` user with restricted flag file.
* Noticed an SQLite database (`database.sqlite`) in `/home`.
* Used `sqlite3` to dump `Users` table and found possible passwords, including one for `bronn`.
* Logged in as `bronn` to retrieve their flag.

---

### 6. Browser Artifact Enumeration on Host 2 (Missed / Poorly Enumerated Step)

* Located Firefox profile directory with `logins.json` and `key4.db` files for saved passwords.
* **Missed initial detailed enumeration of these files**, delaying credential harvesting.
* Later extracted these files via SCP and decrypted saved passwords using `firepwd` tool.
* Found password `ce001480` for user `bran`.

---

### 7. Pivot: SSH into Host 3 as `bran`

* Used decrypted password `ce001480`.
* Retrieved `flag.txt`.

---

### 8. Credential Discovery for User `dany`

* Checked `/home/dany/credentials.txt` and found password `ce16384290b`.
* SSH'd into Host 1 as `dany` using these credentials.
* Retrieved `flag.txt`.

---

### 9. Final Pivot: SSH into Host 4 as `bronn`

* Used password from SQLite DB (`9f39b96305711`).
* Retrieved final `flag.txt`.
* Found user `robert` with another restricted flag file.
* Found `robert`'s password in `/var/mail/bronn`.
* Logged in as `robert` and retrieved last flag.

## Challenges & Missed Enumeration

* **Poor initial enumeration of browser artifacts on Host 2**:
  The Firefox saved passwords in `logins.json` and `key4.db` were discovered late in the process. This delayed obtaining the `bran` user's password and slowed lateral movement.

* **Why it happened:**
  Focus was heavily on file and user enumeration, but saved browser credentials are a classic treasure trove often overlooked in Linux pentests.

* **How to improve:**

  * Always check browser profile directories (`~/.mozilla/firefox/`) for sensitive data.
  * Learn to use tools like `firepwd` to decrypt saved Firefox passwords.
  * Make browser artifact enumeration part of standard pentesting post-exploitation enumeration checklists.

---

## Lessons Learned

* **Credential reuse and saved passwords are common lateral movement vectors.**
  Browser artifacts, private SSH keys, and plaintext credentials in files/mail can unlock multiple machines.

* **Comprehensive enumeration pays off.**
  Missing seemingly small files like Firefox’s `logins.json` can delay a successful attack chain.

* **Document your findings and revisit missed areas.**
  During complex multi-host exercises, it’s common to overlook details — make notes and re-check areas if stuck.

* **Automation helps but don’t rely solely on tools.**
  Manual inspection of user directories often reveals credentials and artifacts that automated tools miss.
